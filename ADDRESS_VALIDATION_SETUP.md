## 7. Testing

### Address Validation & Autocomplete Testing
1. Start typing an address (e.g., "123 Main St")
2. Verify autocomplete suggestions appear after 3+ characters
3. Click on a suggestion to auto-fill the address
4. Enter invalid addresses (e.g., "123 Fake Street")
5. Verify red border and error message
6. Enter valid addresses
7. Verify green border and success message
8. Test address correction suggestions
9. Test clicking outside to close suggestions

### Shipping Rates Testing
1. Complete billing information
2. Proceed to shipping step
3. Verify shipping rates load
4. Test different shipping options
5. Verify costs update in order summary

## 8. Cost Considerations

### Google APIs
- **Address Validation API**: First 1,000 requests per month: Free, Additional: $0.50 per 1,000 requests
- **Places API**: First 1,000 requests per month: Free, Additional: $2.83 per 1,000 requests
- Typical usage: ~$10-30/month for small to medium sites

### UPS API
- Free to use (no per-request charges)
- Requires UPS account
- May require minimum shipping volume

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key not working**: Check Google Cloud Console billing
2. **UPS rates not loading**: Verify UPS credentials and account status
3. **Address validation slow**: Check network connection and API limits

### Fallback Behavior
- If Google Places API fails: Autocomplete suggestions are hidden
- If Google Address Validation API fails: Address validation is skipped
- If UPS API fails: Free shipping is used as fallback
- All errors are logged for debugging

## 10. Security Notes

- All API keys are stored in environment variables
- API calls are made server-side only
- No sensitive data is exposed to client
- Rate limiting is handled by API providers

## 11. Future Enhancements

- ✅ Google Places Autocomplete for address suggestions (COMPLETED)
- Multiple carrier support (FedEx, USPS)
- Package weight/dimension calculation from product data
- Address validation for international addresses
- Shipping insurance options
- Keyboard navigation for autocomplete suggestions
- Recent addresses history
