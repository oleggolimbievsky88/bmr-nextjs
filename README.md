# BMR Suspension E-commerce Site

This is a Next.js application built with the App Router for BMR Suspension.

## Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your database credentials:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment to Vercel

The app loads **products, platforms, and menu data from MySQL**. For production to work, the database must be reachable from Vercel’s servers.

### Required: `DATABASE_URL`

In Vercel, set **`DATABASE_URL`** (the app does **not** use `MYSQL_HOST` / `MYSQL_USER` / etc.):

- **Format:** `mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE`
- **Example:** `mysql://myuser:mypass@db.example.com:3306/bmrsuspension`
- **If your provider requires SSL**, add: `?ssl=true` (e.g. `mysql://.../bmrsuspension?ssl=true`).

**Important:**

- Do **not** use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the host on Vercel; the server runs in the cloud and cannot reach your local machine.
- Use a MySQL host that accepts connections from the internet (e.g. PlanetScale, Railway, Aiven, or a VPS with remote access and firewall rules that allow Vercel).
- Ensure the MySQL user is allowed to connect from any host (`'user'@'%'`) if your provider uses host-based permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### API Route Errors (404/500)

If you encounter 404 errors for routes like `/fitment/[id]` or `/video/[id]`, make sure:

1. The directory structure in the `app` folder is correctly set up
2. The appropriate API routes exist in the `app/api` directory
3. The database connection environment variables are correctly set in Vercel

### Products / platforms / menu not loading on Vercel ("No platforms in this category")

This usually means the app cannot reach the database in production:

1. In Vercel → Project → **Settings → Environment Variables**, set **`DATABASE_URL`** (see "Deployment to Vercel" above). Do not rely on `MYSQL_*` variables; only `DATABASE_URL` is used.
2. Use a **remotely accessible** MySQL host (not `localhost`). Add `?ssl=true` to `DATABASE_URL` if your provider requires SSL.
3. In Vercel → **Deployments** → select a deployment → **Functions** or **Logs**, and check for connection/timeout errors when calling `/api/menu` or product APIs.

## Required Routes

This application requires the following routes to function correctly:

- `/api/menu`
- `/api/products/new-products`
- `/api/platforms/[bodyID]`
- `/fitment/[id]`
- `/video/[id]`
- `/products/bmr-merchandise`
- `/products/gift-cards`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
