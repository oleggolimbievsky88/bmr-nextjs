BMR's polyurethane, non-adjustable tubular control arms for S197 Mustangs (TCA022) are TIG-welded using heavy-duty 1x2-inch boxed steel tubing. This design gives you a strong control arm that greatly improves performance. Spherical bearings offer the highest levels of strength and articulation. When the highest levels of performance are required, BMR uses heavy-duty Teflon-lines FK Bearing spherical bearings. Combined with its greasable, 95-durometer bushings, BMR is able to offer an incredible blend of comfort and performance. These parts are designed for long lasting flawless operation under the harshest conditions at any power level. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings.

BMR Suspension designed the TCA022 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. The stock control arms flex under cornering loads giving you inconsistent handling characteristics. Combine this with soft bushings that have massive amounts of deflection and you're left with poor performance. The TCA022's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much improved repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. BMR's polyurethane bushings are designed to be compliant enough to give you a comfortable ride and absorb NVH, while remaining firm enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment. The bushings easily handle the high compression loads of hard launches and hard acceleration, yet offer plenty of articulation for great handling. These are the perfect upgrade for the enthusiast looking to improve performance at an affordable price, while maintaining acceptable NVH levels and ride quality.

The stock control arm with soft rubber bushings deflects under load and absorbs power instead of transferring it to the tires. BMR's spherical, on-car adjustable tubular control arm for S197 Mustangs (UTCA020) is manufactured from heavy-duty 1 5/8 inch, 0.120-inch wall DOM steel tubing. The center adjuster is CNC-machined from chrome-moly steel with rolled threads for the ultimate in strength and durability. The arms feature TIG-welded chrome-moly tube adapters. This design gives you a strong control arm that greatly improves performance. Spherical bearings offer the highest levels of strength and articulation. When the highest levels of performance are required, BMR uses heavy-duty Teflon-lines Viking Performance spherical bearings.

BMR Suspension designed the UTCA020 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. The stock control arm flexes under even light cornering loads giving you inconsistent handling characteristics. Combine this with soft bushings that have massive amounts of deflection and you're left with poor performance. The UTCA020's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much improved repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. The adjustability allows you to dial in pinion angle for increased traction with reduced NVH. BMR's spherical bearing offers tons of articulation for great handling, whiles remaining strong enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment. These are the perfect upgrade for the enthusiast looking for max performance at an affordable price. When performance is a must, rely on BMR Suspension!

This design gives you strong control arms that greatly improve performance. Greasable, 95-durometer bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings. The package also includes BMR's UCM001 upper control arm mount. This mount fabricated from heavy-duty laser-cut, CNC-formed plate steel for an exact fit. It is 100-percent bolt-in and gives you increased mount strength for high-horsepower applications. The last piece of the package is BMR's lower control arm relocation brackets. BMR's control arm relocation brackets allow you to correct the lower control arm angle, correcting the rear suspension geometry and allowing you to add anti-squat for increased traction. Manufactured from heavy-duty 3/16- and 1/4-inch laser cut, CNC-formed steel plate, the CAB005 are designed to bolt in place, making installation simple and easy.

BMR Suspension designed the CAP003 to work well in street performance, drag race, and handling applications. The stock control arms flex under cornering loads giving you inconsistent handling characteristics. Combine this with soft bushings that have massive amounts of deflection and you're left with poor performance. The CAP001's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much improved repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. BMR's polyurethane bushings are designed to be compliant enough to give you a comfortable ride and absorb NVH, while remaining firm enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment. The bushings easily handle the high compression loads of hard launches and hard acceleration, yet offer plenty of articulation for great handling. The BMR Control Arm Relocation Brackets correct the vehicles instantaneous center, improving drag strip traction and handling traction during corner exiting. BMR can proudly claim that these Relocation Brackets are the only brackets in the industry that have been 1.1 sixty-foot times, BOLTED-ON! We also have many 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 60-foot combinations running these same pieces. These are the perfect upgrades for the enthusiast looking to improve performance at an affordable price, while maintaining acceptable NVH levels and ride quality. When performance is a must, rely on BMR Suspension!

Buying the package saves $40!

LSP001,Lowering Spring Package,"BMR Suspension has taken the guesswork out of making significant handling improvements to the 2005-2014 S197 Mustang, and put it in one convenient package. Countless hours of design, engineering, and track testing gives you the best combination of parts for improved handling on the street and track. Matching specific components provides a great blend of performance, aesthetics, and comfort. <br> <br> BMR's Lowering Spring Package (LSP001) addresses key points of the suspension to improve the ""system."" BMR Suspension designed the LSP001 to work well for street performance and handling applications. BMR's Lowering Spring Package is 100-percent bolt-in and require zero cutting, welding, or modification to the chassis or suspension. Whether you simply want a better handling daily driver, or the ultimate track day car, rely on BMR Suspension! <br> <br> Lowering Springs (SP009)<br> Over time, stock springs sag, get rusty, and simply wear out. BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process.

Countless hours of design, engineering, and track testing gives you the best combination of parts for improved handling on the street and track. Matching specific components provides a great blend of performance, aesthetics, and comfort.

BMR's Lowering Spring Package (LSP001) addresses key points of the suspension to improve the ""system."" BMR Suspension designed the LSP001 to work well for street performance and handling applications. BMR's Lowering Spring Package is 100-percent bolt-in and require zero cutting, welding, or modification to the chassis or suspension. Whether you simply want a better handling daily driver, or the ultimate track day car, rely on BMR Suspension!

Lowering Springs (SP009)
Over time, stock springs sag, get rusty, and simply wear out. BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths. This allows BMR to offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY against spring sag.

Blending aesthetics and performance, BMR has designed the SP009 for the street performance crowd who want to use their cars in a variety of application. These springs will drop the front end of your S197 Mustang 1.5-inches, and feature a fine-tuned spring rate (165lb front, 160lb rear) to give you great handling and a smooth ride. The linear spring rate offers plenty of support, keeping the body flat and level in the corners, while remaining soft enough for a comfortable ride on any road.
Stock sway bars have low torsional spring rates because they are manufactured from small diameter bar stock or tubing.

XSB005,"Xtreme Anti-roll Bar Kit, Rear, Hollow 35mm","Hard launches from high horsepower cars at the drag strip require more that just a normal street-style sway bar. BMR Suspension's Xtreme Anti Roll Bar for 2005-2014 Mustang or 2007-2014 Shelby GT500 allows you to launch harder without excessive body roll limiting traction, with little sacrifice to your Mustang's street manners. Manufactured from heavy-wall 1.375-inch DOM tubing, BMR's Xtreme Anti Roll Bar (XSB005) is designed to eliminate body roll and transfer as much power as possible to the rear wheels. The XSB005 attaches to your Mustang with polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. These bushings are molded from 95-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keep grease in the bushing under high compression loads. The fabricated laser cut, steel sway bar arms are reinforced to add strength and minimize deflection.<br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the XSB005 sway bar for street performance and drag race applications. The large adjustable sway bar has three positions, giving you the versatility to drive to the track and race at the track with the same sway bar. The XSB005 gives you as much as 4,090% increase (2,430%, 3,080%, and 4,090%) in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model).These rate increases and adjustability allow you to almost eliminate body roll so you can leave the starting line harder with maximum traction. The hollow design gives you loads of strength without adding a lot of weight. This allows for more body roll control, which equals more traction and consistent launches.

DRP001,Drag Race Package (Level 1),"BMR Suspension has taken the guesswork out of making huge launch improvements to the S197 Mustang, and put it all in one convenient package. Countless hours of design, engineering, and track testing gives you the best combination of parts for remarkable traction and launch consistency on the street and track. Matching specific components and improving suspension geometry provides you with an incredible blend of performance, aesthetics, and comfort. This is the perfect suspension solution for anyone looking for the ultimate in street and track performance. <br> <br> BMR's DRP001 Level 1 Drag Race Package (DRP001) addresses all the major points of the rear suspension, improving the ""system"" and not just a few components. BMR Suspension designed the DRP001 to work well for street performance and drag race applications. The entire system is 100-percent bolt-in and require zero cutting, welding, or modification to the chassis or suspension. <br> <br> BMR's DRP001 Level 1 Drag Race Package is designed to give you the ultimate in straight-line performance, while remaining comfortable enough to drive on the street. The combination of parts is designed to truly transform the car into a track monster. This package address nearly all parts of the rear suspension system, and the installation is best suited for a seasoned mechanic. Whether you simply want more traction for your daily driver, or the ultimate drag strip car, rely on BMR Suspension!<br> <br> Control Arm Relocation Brackets (CAB005)<br> BMR's bolt-on relocation brackets for S197 Mustangs are the ultimate in strength and adjustability. The stock lower control arm mounting location can give you insufficient lower control arm angle on lowered vehicles. BMR's control arm relocation brackets allow you to correct the lower control arm angle, correcting the rear suspension geometry and allowing you to add anti-squat for increased traction. Manufactured from heavy-duty 3/16- and 1/4-inch laser cut, CNC-formed steel plate, the CAB005 are designed to bolt in place, making installation simple and easy.<br> <br> The stock control arm mounting position is fine for stock height vehicles, but once you lower your car, the control arms change and need to be corrected. The CAB005s allow you lower the lower control arms' rear mounting position by as much as 3 inches, correcting the control arm angles. This also allows you to make instant center changes for race applications. BMR Suspension designed the CAB005 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. It is engineering to bolt on and stand up to extremely high horsepower and torque levels, as well as the hardest drag strip launches without moving on the rearend housing.<br> <br> Lower Control Arms (TCA019)<br> Stock stamped steel control arms with soft rubber bushings deflect under load and absorb power instead of transferring it to the tires. BMR's polyurethane, non-adjustable tubular control arms for S197 Mustangs (TCA019) are TIG-welded using heavy-duty 1.25x2-inch boxed steel tubing. This design gives you a strong control arm that greatly improves performance. Greasable, 95-durometer bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings. <br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the TCA019 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. The stock control arms flex under cornering loads giving you inconsistent handling characteristics. Combine this with soft bushings that have massive amounts of deflection and you're left with poor performance. The TCA019's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much improved repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. BMR's polyurethane bushings are designed to be compliant enough to give you a comfortable ride and absorb NVH, while remaining firm enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment. The bushings easily handle the high compression loads of hard launches and hard acceleration, yet offer plenty of articulation for great handling. These are the perfect upgrade for the enthusiast looking to improve performance at an affordable price, while maintaining acceptable NVH levels and ride quality.<br> <br> Upper Control Arm Mount (UCM001)<br> BMR's upper control arm mount is a direct replacement for the OE mount and requires no drilling or welding to install. The last generation Fox body Mustangs had upper control arm mounts incorporated into the frame. They also had two upper control arms sharing the load but drag racers were continually ripping the mounts off of the frame when racing. The solution for those cars was to weld reinforcement plates onto the frame. This new Mustang platform only has one upper control arm and the mount is only bolted into place. Our upper mount is made from heavy-duty 1/4"" plate and can be either bolted or welded into place. Additionally it has dual control arm mounting points for changing instant center.<br> <br> Adjustable Upper Control Arm (UTCA019)<br> Stock control arms with soft rubber bushings deflect under load and absorb power instead of transferring it to the tires. BMR's polyurethane, on-car adjustable tubular control arm for S197 Mustangs (UTCA019) is manufactured from heavy-duty 1 5/8 inch, 0.120-inch wall DOM steel tubing. The center adjuster is CNC-machined from chrome-moly steel with rolled threads for the ultimate in strength and durability. The arms feature TIG-welded chrome-moly tube adapters. This design gives you a strong control arm that greatly improves performance. Two-inch greasable, 95-durometer bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which keeps grease in the bushing, even under heavy load. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings. <br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the UTCA019 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. The stock control arm flexes under even light cornering loads giving you inconsistent handling characteristics. Combine this with soft bushings that have massive amounts of deflection and you're left with poor performance. The UTCA019's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much improved repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. BMR's polyurethane bushings are designed to be compliant enough to give you a comfortable ride and absorb NVH, while remaining firm enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment. The bushings easily handle the high compression loads of hard launches and hard acceleration, yet offer plenty of articulation for great handling. The adjustable design allows for fine-tuning of the pinion angle for proper driveline alignment. These are the perfect upgrade for the enthusiast looking to improve performance, while maintaining acceptable NVH levels and ride quality.<br> <br> Differential Housing Bushing (EN001)<br> Three link suspensions place excessive loads on the upper link bushings. In the 2005-2014 Mustangs, two bushings are responsible for handling the same torque load that four bushings had done before. Additionally, these bushings are subjected to more ""twist"" than before since the rearend can better articulate in a three link design. In order to allow free articulation, the OE rearend bushing is designed to flex. This flex is great for handling, but under straight line acceleration, it contributes to wheelhop and inconsistent launch characteristics.<br> <br> BMR Suspension offers a no-compromise solution with it's dual-durometer five-piece polyurethane replacement bushing. By designing the bushing as a multi-piece unit, it allowed them to keep the inside portion stiff for great straight-line acceleration and the outside portions soft for bind-free articulation. <br> <br> ***NOTE: requires use of existing bushing shell.***<br> <br> Adjustable Rear Shocks (Viking B226)<br> The Viking double adjustable shocks (Warrior Series) feature easy bolt-in installation in the stock mounting locations. Gone are the days of removing the shock to adjust valving because you can adjust the Vikings with just the turn of a knob while they are mounted on the car.<br> <br> A 5/8"" centerless ground, hard chrome piston rod provides increased durability and eliminates piston rod flex. The machined, forged aluminum body is lightweight and stronger than billet. The body is bright anodized for unmatched durability, ease of maintenance and show winning appearance.

All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths. This allows BMR to offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY against spring sag.<br> <br> Blending aesthetics and performance, BMR has designed the SP009 for the street performance crowd who want to use their cars in a variety of application.

Manufactured from heavy-wall 35mm DOM tubing, the SB022 is cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. Thrust washers are welded to the bar to locate the sway bar bushing mounts. This is critical as it properly locates the sway bar and prevents lateral movement during hard cornering maneuvers. The sway bar mounts to the car using polyurethane bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The steel sway bar mounting brackets are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 3-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.<br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the SB022 sway bar for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar's three positions give you the versatility to drive to and from the road course or autocross and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar.

These springs will drop the front end of your S197 Mustang 1.5-inches, and feature a fine-tuned spring rate (165lb front, 160lb rear) to give you great handling and a smooth ride. The linear spring rate offers plenty of support, keeping the body flat and level in the corners, while remaining soft enough for a comfortable ride on any road.

Front Sway Bars (SB022)
Stock sway bars have low torsional spring rates because they are manufactured from small diameter bar stock or tubing. BMR Suspension's SB022 front sway bar was designed by factoring in the vehicle weight, application, motion ratio, coil spring rate, and adjustability requirements. Manufactured from heavy-wall 35mm DOM tubing, the SB022 is cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. Thrust washers are welded to the bar to locate the sway bar bushing mounts. This is critical as it properly locates the sway bar and prevents lateral movement during hard cornering maneuvers. The sway bar mounts to the car using polyurethane bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The steel sway bar mounting brackets are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 3-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.

BMR Suspension designed the SB022 sway bar for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar's three positions give you the versatility to drive to and from the road course or autocross and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar. The rate increases and adjustability allow you to fine-tune the handling characteristics of your Mustang so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. The hollow design allows for loads of strength in the lightest package possible. This means increased performance with no sacrifices. The SB022 attaches to your Mustang with 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. This allows for more sway bar control, and more control equals better handling.

Rear Sway Bar (SB023)
Stock sway bars have low torsional spring rates because they are manufactured from small diameter bar stock or tubing. BMR Suspension's SB023 rear sway bar was designed by factoring in the vehicle weight, application, motion ratio, coil spring rate, and adjustability requirements. Manufactured from heavy-duty 22mm bar stock, the SB023 is cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. The SB023 attaches to your Mustang with billet aluminum end links and 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keep grease in the bushing. The CNC-machined, billet aluminum sway bar end links eliminate deflection.

BMR Suspension designed the SB023 sway bar for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The non-adjustable SB023 gives you a 52% increase in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). The rate increases gives you improved handling characteristics so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. This allows for more sway bar control, which equals better handling.

PHR006
Factory S197 Mustang Panhard rods are made from weak U-shaped stamped steel with soft rubber bushings that allow excessive deflection under load. BMR Suspension's PHR006 Panhard rod is made 1.25-inch, 0.120-inch wall DOM tubing with TIG-welded chrome-moly tube adapters. The PHR006 features BMR's CNC-machined center adjuster, which is made from 4130 chrome-moly with rolled threads. The PHR006 features greasable, 95-durometer bushings, which add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve, keeping grease in the bushing under high compression loads. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings.

BMR Suspension designed the PHR006 to work well for street performance, drag race, and road race applications. The heavy-duty construction eliminates the deflection seen in stamped-steel Panhard rods. Other Panhard rods on the market include rubber bushings that will deflect under heavy loads. The 95-durometer polyurethane bushings of the PHR006 reduce bushing deflection, giving you much-improved, repeatable handling characteristics on the street, starting line, or in aggressive corners. The on-car adjustable design makes the PHR006 great lowered Mustangs. This gives you all the strength and adjustability you need for great handling without huge increases in NVH.

PHR007
Factory Mustang Panhard rod supports are made from weak U-shaped stamped steel that allows excessive deflection under load. BMR Suspension's PHR007 Panhard rod support brace is made from boxed tubing for extra strength. The PHR007 adds tons of strength for increased lateral loads seen during cornering situations and hard launches.

BMR Suspension designed the PHR007 to work well for street performance, drag race, and road race applications.

This allows for fine-tuning and bind-free suspension articulation needed for superior handling. This is the perfect Panhard rod for the enthusiast that requires maximum performance from the suspension.

CAB005
BMR's bolt-on relocation brackets for S197 Mustangs are the ultimate in strength and adjustability. The stock lower control arm mounting location can give you insufficient lower control arm angle on lowered vehicles. BMR's control arm relocation brackets allow you to correct the lower control arm angle, correcting the rear suspension geometry and allowing you to add anti-squat for increased traction. Manufactured from heavy-duty 3/16- and 1/4-inch laser cut, CNC-formed steel plate, the CAB005 are designed to bolt in place, making installation simple and easy.

The stock control arm mounting position is fine for stock height vehicles, but once you lower your car, the control arms change and need to be corrected. The CAB005s allow you lower the lower control arms' rear mounting position by as much as 3 inches, correcting the control arm angles. This also allows you to make instant center changes for race applications. BMR Suspension designed the CAB005 to work well in street performance, drag race, and road race applications. It is engineering to bolt on and stand up to extremely high horsepower and torque levels, as well as the hardest drag strip launches without moving on the rearend housing.

PHR013,"Panhard Rod, DOM, On-car Adj, Poly Bushing/Rod End Combo","A Panhard rod is a suspension link that both locates the lateral position of the rear axle housing and controls side-to-side movement. Factory S197 Mustang Panhard rods are made from weak U-shaped stamped steel with soft rubber bushings that allow excessive deflection under load. BMR Suspension's PHR013 Panhard rod is made 1.25-inch, 0.120-inch wall DOM tubing with TIG-welded chrome-moly tube adapters. The PHR013 features BMR's CNC-machined center adjuster, which is made from 4130 chrome-moly with rolled threads. One end of the rod features a zinc-plated two-piece, X-series, heat-treated, chrome-moly, self-lubricating, Teflon-lined rod end. It also features 304 stainless steel, custom designed rod end spacers. The other uses a greasable, 95-durometer bushing, which adds a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve, keeping grease in the bushing under high compression loads. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings.

The 95-durometer polyurethane bushings of the PHR013 reduce bushing deflection, giving you much-improved, repeatable handling characteristics on the street, starting line, or in aggressive corners. The rod end further reduces deflection for high horsepower and track applications. The chrome-moly center adjuster makes the PHR013 on-car adjustable, so all adjustments can be made without removing the Panhard rod.

Stock stamped steel control arms with soft rubber bushings deflect under load and absorb power instead of transferring it to the tires. BMR's polyurethane, non-adjustable tubular control arms for S197 Mustangs (TCA019) are TIG-welded using heavy-duty 1x2-inch boxed steel tubing. This design gives you a strong control arm that greatly improves performance. Greasable, 95-durometer bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings.

This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings. The stock lower control arm mounting location can give you insufficient lower control arm angle on lowered vehicles. BMR's control arm relocation brackets allow you to correct the lower control arm angle, correcting the rear suspension geometry and allowing you to add anti-squat for increased traction.

The AWP003's heavy-duty construction eliminates control arm flex, giving you much better repeatability on the street, starting line, or in the corners. BMR's polyurethane bushings are designed to be compliant enough to give you a comfortable ride and absorb NVH, while remaining firm enough to stand up to high loads of any performance environment.

BMR Suspension's SB022 front sway bar was designed by factoring in the vehicle weight, application, motion ratio, coil spring rate, and adjustability requirements. Manufactured from heavy-wall 35mm DOM tubing, the SB022/SB023 are cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. Thrust washers are welded to the bar to locate the sway bar bushing mounts. This is critical as it properly locates the sway bar and prevents lateral movement during hard cornering maneuvers. The sway bar mounts to the car using polyurethane bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The steel sway bar mounting brackets are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 3-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.<br> <br> SB022<br> BMR Suspension designed the SB022 sway bars for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar's three positions give you the versatility to drive to and from the road course or autocross and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar. The rate increases and adjustability allow you to fine-tune the handling characteristics of your Mustang so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. The hollow design allows for loads of strength in the lightest package possible. This means increased performance with no sacrifices. The SB022 attaches to your Mustang with 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. This allows for more sway bar control, and more control equals better handling.<br> <br> SB023<br> BMR Suspension designed the SB023 sway bar for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The non-adjustable SB023 gives you a 52% increase in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). The rate increases gives you improved handling characteristics so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll.

Manufactured from heavy-wall 35mm DOM tubing, the SB022/SB023 are cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. Thrust washers are welded to the bar to locate the sway bar bushing mounts. This is critical as it properly locates the sway bar and prevents lateral movement during hard cornering maneuvers. The sway bar mounts to the car using polyurethane bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The steel sway bar mounting brackets are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 3-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.

SB022
BMR Suspension designed the SB022 sway bars for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar's three positions give you the versatility to drive to and from the road course or autocross and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar. The rate increases and adjustability allow you to fine-tune the handling characteristics of your Mustang so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. The hollow design allows for loads of strength in the lightest package possible. This means increased performance with no sacrifices. The SB022 attaches to your Mustang with 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. This allows for more sway bar control, and more control equals better handling.

SB023
BMR Suspension designed the SB023 sway bar for street performance, autocross, and road race applications. The non-adjustable SB023 gives you a 52% increase in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). The rate increases gives you improved handling characteristics so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. This allows for more sway bar control, which equals better handling.

UTCA033,"Upper Control Arm, DOM, On-car Adj, Spherical Bearing","Launching harder, reducing wheel hop, and adding cornering consistency to your 2011-2014 Ford Mustang is easy with an upper control arm from BMR Suspension.

BMR's spherical, on-car adjustable tubular control arm for S197 Mustangs (UTCA033) is manufactured from heavy-duty 1 5/8 inch, 0.120-inch wall DOM steel tubing. The center adjuster is CNC-machined from chrome-moly steel with rolled threads for the ultimate in strength and durability. The arms feature TIG-welded chrome-moly tube adapters.

SB042,"Sway Bar Kit With Bushings, Rear, Adjustable, Hollow 25mm","The two primary functions of sway bars are to control body roll and to determine the understeer or oversteer behavior of a vehicle. Stock sway bars have low torsional spring rates because they are manufactured from small diameter bar stock or tubing. BMR Suspension's SB042 rear sway bar was designed by factoring in the vehicle weight, application, motion ratio, coil spring rate, and adjustability requirements. Manufactured from heavy-wall 25mm DOM tubing, the SB042 is cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. The SB042 attaches to your Mustang with fabricated end links and 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The fabricated laser cut, TIG-welded steel sway bar end links are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 4-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.<br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the SB042 sway bar for street performance, drag race, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar has four positions, giving you the versatility to drive to and from the track and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar. The SB042 gives you a 16%-270% increase in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). These rate increases and adjustability allow you to fine-tune the handling characteristics of the suspension so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. The hollow design allows for loads of strength without adding a lot of weight.

Stock sway bars have low torsional spring rates because they are manufactured from small diameter bar stock or tubing. BMR Suspension's SB042 rear sway bar was designed by factoring in the vehicle weight, application, motion ratio, coil spring rate, and adjustability requirements. Manufactured from heavy-wall 25mm DOM tubing, the SB042 is cold formed to better resist torsional fatigue and retain its ""memory"" far longer than the hot-formed bars used by many competitors. The sway bar is CNC-formed for exact manufacturing tolerances and repeatable high quality. The SB042 attaches to your Mustang with fabricated end links and 88-durometer polyurethane bushings, reducing the deflection from the stock rubber bushings. These bushings are molded from 88-durometer, low-deflection, polyurethane, and are internally fluted to keeps grease in the bushing. The fabricated laser cut, TIG-welded steel sway bar end links are reinforced to minimize deflection. The sway bar is 4-way adjustable to tune the amount of torsional spring rate and to determine the handling characteristics (understeer/oversteer) of the vehicle.

BMR Suspension designed the SB042 sway bar for street performance, drag race, autocross, and road race applications. The large adjustable sway bar has four positions, giving you the versatility to drive to and from the track and still out handle the competition with the same sway bar. The SB042 gives you a 16%-270% increase in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). These rate increases and adjustability allow you to fine-tune the handling characteristics of the suspension so you can drive harder through corners with minimal body roll. The hollow design allows for loads of strength without adding a lot of weight. If you're a drag racer, but don't want a solid-mounted antiroll bar on the street, the SB042 is stiff enough to keep the body flat for hard launches and soft enough to maintain streetability. This allows for more sway bar control, which equals better handling. When performance is a must, rely on BMR Suspension!

BMR Suspension's SB042 sway bars are available in black hammertone and red powdercoat for long-lasting good looks. Installation time is about 1-2 hours. Proudly made in the U.S.A.!

BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths.

Over time, stock springs sag, get rusty, and simply wear out. BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths. This allows BMR to offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY against spring sag.

Blending aesthetics and performance, BMR has designed the SP067 for the handling crowd who uses their car on the road course or at the autocross. These springs will drop the rear of your S197 Mustang 1.5-inches and feature a fine-tuned spring rate to give you great handling. The 200 lb/inch dual-rate spring offers plenty of support, keeping the body flat and level in the corners. The lowered stance and increased spring rate decreases body roll and gives you a lower center of gravity for increased driver control in aggressive cornering situations. Combine this with BMR adjustable sway bars and you have the ultimate in handling and performance. When performance and looks are a must, rely on BMR Suspension!

BMR rear springs retain the factory ""hourglass"" shape designed by Ford engineers. This important feature provides a ""variable natural frequency"" in the spring to help counteract damaging wheelhop. This is a feature of the OE springs often overlooked by other companies simply because they don't realize it's benefits in multi-purpose applications.

MM007,"Motor Mount Kit, Polyurethane Bushings","Engine movement (deflection) is wasted horsepower, and that power is yours! BMR Suspension wants you to take it back with its polyurethane motor mounts for 2005 to 2014 Ford Mustang. BMR's new motor mounts (MM007) are far superior to the bulky, stock bushings, which are designed for comfort, not performance. BMR manufactures its MM007 polyurethane motor mounts in its Florida facility from CNC-laser cut ¼-inch plate steel with aircraft-grade 7075 billet aluminum spacers and 95-durometer polyurethane bushings. The kit is completed with Grade-8 hardware. <br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the MM007 to be the perfect (100% bolt-in) motor mount for any power level or application (street performance, drag race, and road race) where engine deflection needs to be reduced. The factory motor mounts are designed to dampen engine vibration, giving you the smoothest and most comfortable experience possible. Unfortunately, this does little to limit engine movement. This deflection means lackluster throttle response, slower reaction times, and less accurate shifts in manual-equipped cars. BMR's MM007 polyurethane motor mounts limit engine deflection, while isolating much of the engine vibration from the vehicle's occupants. This means you won't feel a big increase in NVH. The reduction in deflection leads to less wasted power as it's transferred to the tires, improving your driving experience on both the street and track. And less drivetrain movement means more accurate shifts as you row through the gears. The MM007 weighs over 50-percent less than the factory engine mounts (8-pounds factory, 3.8-pounds MM007). They are also height adjustable. Simply remove the aluminum spacers to lower the engine a ¼- or 1/2-inch in the engine bay (larger engine drops are possible, call for more info).

SMK013,"Sway Bar Mount, Billet Alum Mount, 1.375"" Delrin Bushing","If you've installed one of BMR Suspension's 1 3/8-inch sway bars or Xtreme Anti Roll Bars and want to improve its level of body roll control, upgrade the sway bar mounts and bushings with a Billet Aluminum/Delrin Sway Bar Mounting Kit from BMR Suspension. Most BMR sway bars come with formed steel sway bar mounts with polyurethane bushings. This gives you an effective sway bar mounting solution that works great for limiting the amount of wasted sway bar rate due to sway bar bushing deflection. Under extreme loads, slight bushing deflection can absorbs sway bar rate and allow for slight amounts of body roll. BMR designed its Billet Aluminum/Delrin Sway Bar Mounting Kit to solidly mount the sway bar to the chassis eliminating any bushing deflection. Eliminating this deflection will reduce body roll and increase handling and launch consistency. <br> <br> Designed for max-effort street performance, drag race, and handling applications, BMR's Billet Aluminum/Delrin Sway Bar Mounting Kit replaces the formed saddle and poly bushing assembly with CNC-machined billet aluminum saddles and CNC-machined Delrin bushings. This design eliminates the small amount of deflection seen in the formed saddles and poly bushings when extreme loads are applied. The saddles and Delrin bushings are CNC-machined, giving you a perfect fit, and the strength to withstand any form of performance driving.

Most BMR sway bars come with formed steel sway bar mounts with polyurethane bushings. This gives you an effective sway bar mounting solution that works great for limiting the amount of wasted sway bar rate due to sway bar bushing deflection. Under extreme loads, slight bushing deflection can absorbs sway bar rate and allow for slight amounts of body roll. BMR designed its Billet Aluminum/Delrin Sway Bar Mounting Kit to solidly mount the sway bar to the chassis eliminating any bushing deflection. Eliminating this deflection will reduce body roll and increase handling and launch consistency.

Designed for max-effort street performance, drag race, and handling applications, BMR's Billet Aluminum/Delrin Sway Bar Mounting Kit replaces the formed saddle and poly bushing assembly with CNC-machined billet aluminum saddles and CNC-machined Delrin bushings. This design eliminates the small amount of deflection seen in the formed saddles and poly bushings when extreme loads are applied. The saddles and Delrin bushings are CNC-machined, giving you a perfect fit, and the strength to withstand any form of performance driving. BMR's Delrin bushings are also greasable for smooth operation and long life.

XSB012,"Xtreme Anti Roll Bar Kit, Bolt-on, Bearing","Hard launches from high horsepower cars at the drag strip require more that just a normal street-style sway bar. BMR Suspension's Xtreme Anti Roll Bar for 2005-2014 Mustang or 2007-2014 Shelby GT500 allows you to launch harder without excessive body roll limiting traction. Manufactured from heavy-wall 1.375-inch DOM tubing, BMR's Xtreme Anti Roll Bar (XSB012) is designed to eliminate body roll and transfer as much power as possible to the rear wheels. The XSB012 attaches to your Mustang with heavy-duty spherical bearings. The mounting plats attach to the stock lower control arm mounts or BMR's CAB005 control arm relocation brackets. The bar is 100% bolt-on and requires zero modification or fabrication to the chassis or rearend. The fabricated laser cut, steel sway bar arms are reinforced to add strength and minimize deflection.<br> <br> BMR Suspension designed the XSB012 sway bar for drag race applications (this bar is not recommended for street use). The large adjustable sway bar has two positions, giving you the versatility to dial in the perfect amount of body roll. The XSB012 gives you as much as 2,070% increase (2,070%, and 1,668%) in rate over the stock bar (depending on year and model). These rate increases and adjustability allow you to almost eliminate body roll so you can leave the starting line harder with maximum traction. The hollow design gives you loads of strength without adding a lot of weight. The heavy-duty spherical bearings solidly mount the sway bar to the chassis, giving you zero deflection. This allows for better body roll control, which equals more traction and consistent launches.

SP069R-SD,"***SCRATCH & DENT*** - Lowering Springs, Front, 1.5"" Drop, Drag, GT","***SCRATCH & DENT***<br> BMR Suspension's scratch and dent products usually have minor to moderate aesthetic defects. Due to the cost of stripping and recoating, BMR has chosen to leave the parts as-is and sell them parts at a discounted price.<br> <br> There is nothing like the aggressive look of a car with the right stance! Over time, stock springs sag, get rusty, and simply wear out. BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths. This allows BMR to offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY against spring sag.<br> <br> Blending aesthetics and performance, BMR has designed the SP069 for the Mustang owners who spend a lot of time at the drag strip. These springs will drop the front end of your S197 Mustang approximately 1.5-inches and feature a fine-tuned spring rate to give you improved launches. The 150 lb/inch linear spring rate is soft enough for great front-end travel at the drag strip. When performance and looks are a must, rely on BMR Suspension!<br> <br> BMR rear springs retain the factory ""hourglass"" shape designed by Ford engineers. This important feature provides a ""variable natural frequency"" in the spring to help counteract damaging wheelhop.

BMR Suspension's scratch and dent products usually have minor to moderate aesthetic defects. Due to the cost of stripping and recoating, BMR has chosen to leave the parts as-is and sell them parts at a discounted price.

There is nothing like the aggressive look of a car with the right stance! Over time, stock springs sag, get rusty, and simply wear out. BMR Suspension believes the right springs go beyond looks, your S197 needs to perform, too! All BMR springs are manufactured from chrome silicon high-tensile spring wire, and are cold wound on a CNC coiling machine. The CNC coiling head can adjust the spring diameter in real time to ensure that every spring is exactly the same. This guarantees that your right spring matches your left spring. Every BMR spring is compressed solid at the factory, not once, but twice. This gives the spring its permanent set, and guarantees no sag. BMR springs are stress-relieved at 750 degrees F, ensuring most stresses induced during the winding process are eliminated. All springs are then shot-peened to eliminate residual surface stresses. Many spring manufacturers skip this step, but BMR insists on this operation as part of our spring manufacturing process. Every spring is computer tested as the last step, every spring, not just a sample from each batch. Each spring is loaded in the spring tester at the factory, then compressed and the CNC load cell measures the force for a variety of spring lengths. This allows BMR to offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY against spring sag.

Blending aesthetics and performance, BMR has designed the SP069 for the Mustang owners who spend a lot of time at the drag strip. These springs will drop the front end of your S197 Mustang approximately 1.5-inches and feature a fine-tuned spring rate to give you improved launches. The 150 lb/inch linear spring rate is soft enough for great front-end travel at the drag strip. When performance and looks are a must, rely on BMR Suspension!

BMR rear springs retain the factory ""hourglass"" shape designed by Ford engineers. This important feature provides a ""variable natural frequency"" in the spring to help counteract damaging wheelhop. This is a feature of the OE springs often overlooked by other companies simply because they don't realize it's benefits in multi-purpose applications.

BMR Suspension's scratch and dent products usually have minor to moderate aesthetic defects (scratches or chips in powder coat, larger or more major defects will be listed). Due to the cost of stripping and re-coating, BMR has chosen to leave the parts as-is and sell them at a discounted price.

-arms are one of the most important, yet overlooked suspension components. They are the direct link between the front wheels and the chassis. Any deflection causes a change in alignment, which results in poor performance and driving feel. Fabricated from heavy-duty 1.25-inch, 0.095-inch wall DOM tubing, deflection is eliminated with A-arms from BMR Suspension. BMR's AA755 Lower A-arms are equipped with greasable heavy-duty ball joints, 95-durometer polyurethane bushings (front mount), and greasable Delrin bushings (rear mount) to handle the high loads. Polyurethane bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR's bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. This efficient lubrication ensures quiet, reliable operation over the life of the bushings.

ARB753,"Anti-roll Bar Kit, Rear, Bolt-on,bearing, Hollow 1.5""","Hard launches from high horsepower cars at the drag strip require more that just a normal street-style sway bar. BMR Suspension's Extreme Anti Roll Bar for 2005-2014 Mustang or 2007-2014 Shelby GT500 allows you to launch harder without excessive body roll limiting traction. Manufactured from heavy-wall 1.5-inch DOM tubing, BMR's Anti Roll Bar (ARB753) is our strongest and stiffest Anti-Roll Bar for the S197 Mustang platform. The BMR Extreme Anti Roll bar is strictly designed to eliminate body roll and transfer maximum power to the rear wheels. The ARB753 attaches to your Mustang with heavy-duty spherical bearings. The mounting plates attach to the stock lower control arm mounts or BMR's CAB005 control arm relocation brackets.

The rate increases and adjustability allow you to virtually eliminate body roll so you can leave the starting line harder with maximum traction. The hollow design gives you loads of strength without adding a lot of weight. The heavy-duty spherical bearings solidly mount the sway bar to the chassis, reducing deflection.
