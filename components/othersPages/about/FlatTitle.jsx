              Since 1998
              <p>
                When BMR Suspension began back in 1998, it was difficult for
                performance automotive enthusiasts to find suspension products
                that had an innovative design and quality construction at an
                affordable price. BMR turned this market void into a business
                philosophy, and has been serving our customer's needs ever
                since. Currently offering chassis, suspension, and drivetrain
                products for 22 different vehicles, BMR is the leading
                suspension manufacturer in many of the market segments that it
                serves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you are interested in street performance, hardcore drag
                racing, or handling applications, BMR Suspension has the
                products that you need. Proudly made in the U.S.A. in a
                manufacturing facility near Tampa, Florida, American workers
                cut, bend, notch, drill, and mill components from American-made
                DOM and chrome-moly steel. Then, every product is fixture-welded
                to maintain consistent quality. Workers bead-blast parts and
                then powdercoat them using BMR's in-house powdercoating line.
                Finished parts are then assembled and packaged in the assembly
                department. By manufacturing every product in house, BMR can
                control the quality at every stage of the manufacturing
                process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                BMR Suspension products fit and work so well because they are
                street driven and track tested on BMR project vehicles. Past
                project cars include a 2005 Mustang drag car, a 2005 Mustang
                street car, a 2004 GTO, and a 1994 Camaro. BMR's current project
                vehicles include a 2016 Camaro, three 2015 Mustang GTs, a 2011
                Mustang GT, a 2010 Camaro, and a 1969 Camaro. As if that were
                not enough, BMR also has a 2009 G8 GT, a 2008 Trailblazer SS,a
                2003 Mach 1 Mustang, a 2000 Grand Prix GTP, a 1998 Camaro, a
                1990 Mustang LX, a 1971 Camaro, a 1970 Chevelle, a 1967
                Chevelle, and a 1968 GTO. But it is more than just great
                vehicles-virtually every BMR employee is a racer or hot rodder,
                as well. This love of racing is demonstrated everyday in BMR's
                customer service, design innovation, and manufacturing
                quality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                By continuing to push the envelope in product design innovation
                and manufacturing technology, you can be sure that BMR
                Suspension will continue to offer the most innovative,
                quality-oriented, affordable suspension products available. When
                performance is a must, rely on BMR Suspension! &lt;\/p&gt;",
